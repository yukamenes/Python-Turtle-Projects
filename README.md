# 🐢 Turtle Mini-Projects Collection  

This repository contains **four small Python projects**, each built using the `turtle` graphics module.  
They are designed for learning, fun experimentation, and teaching beginners how code interacts with graphics, shapes, keyboard controls, and simple game logic.

## 📂 Projects Overview

| # | Project | Description | File |
|---|---------|-------------|------|
| **1** | **Memory Game** | Random shapes appear for 5 seconds — your task is to remember how many were drawn. | `memory_game/memory_game.py` |
| **2** | **Turtle Controller** | Move the turtle with **WASD**, draw freely, press **C** to clear the screen. | `turtle_controller/controller.py` |
| **3** | **Drawing App** | Menu-based drawing tool for squares, circles, triangles, rectangles, and text. | `drawing_app/drawing_app.py` |
| **4** | **Turtle Race** | Bet on a colored turtle and watch them race across the screen! | `turtle_race/turtle_race.py` |
